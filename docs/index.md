# NXOS Provider

The NXOS provider provides resources to interact with one or [more](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/nxos/latest/docs/guides/manage_multiple_devices) Cisco NX-OS devices. Each resource or data source maps to a single NX-OS DME object. There are several [Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=nxos) available which offer a certain level of abstraction and therefore not requiring in-depth knowledge of the DME object model.

The following example repositories exist to demonstrate the use of the provider:

- [Nexus 9000 EVPN Fabric](https://github.com/netascode/terraform-nxos-evpn-example)
- [Nexus 9000 ACLs](https://github.com/netascode/terraform-nxos-acl-example)

It communicates with NX-OS devices via the NX-API REST, which requires the following device configuration.

```
feature nxapi
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "nxos" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  url      = "https://10.1.1.1"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `devices` (Attributes List) This can be used to manage a list of devices from a single provider. All devices must use the same credentials. Each resource and data source has an optional attribute named `device`, which can then select a device by its name from this list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
- `insecure` (Boolean) Allow insecure HTTPS client. This can also be set as the NXOS_INSECURE environment variable. Defaults to `true`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the NX-OS device account. This can also be set as the NXOS_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `retries` (Number) Number of retries for REST API calls. This can also be set as the NXOS_RETRIES environment variable. Defaults to `3`.
- `url` (String) URL of the Cisco NX-OS device. This can also be set as the NXOS_URL environment variable. If no URL is provided, the URL of the first device from the `devices` list is being used.
- `username` (String) Username for the NX-OS device account. This can also be set as the NXOS_USERNAME environment variable.

### Nested Schema for `devices`

Required:

- `name` (String) Device name.
- `url` (String) URL of the Cisco NX-OS device.

Optional:

- `managed` (Boolean) Enable or disable device management. This can be used to temporarily skip a device due to maintainance for example. Defaults to `true`.
