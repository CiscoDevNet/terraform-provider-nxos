# NXOS Provider

The NXOS provider provides resources to interact with one or [more](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/nxos/latest/docs/guides/manage_multiple_devices) Cisco NX-OS devices.

It communicates with NX-OS devices via the NX-API REST, which requires the following device configuration.

```
feature nxapi
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform  | Version |
