# nxos_rest (Resource)

Manages NX-OS DME Objects via REST API calls. This resource can manage a single API object and its children. It is able to read the state and therefore reconcile configuration drift.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "nxos_rest" "l1PhysIf" {
  dn         = "sys/intf/phys-[eth1/1]"
  class_name = "l1PhysIf"
  content = {
    id   = "eth1/1"
    mode = "trunk"
  }
}

resource "nxos_rest" "ipqosCMapInst" {
  dn         = "sys/ipqos/dflt/c/name-[CM1]"
  class_name = "ipqosCMapInst"
  content = {
    name = "CM1"
  }
  children = [
    {
      rn         = "dscp-ef"
      class_name = "ipqosDscp"
      content = {
        val = "ef"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `class_name` (String) Which class object is being created. (Make sure there is no colon in the classname)
- `dn` (String) Distinguished name of object being managed including its relative name, e.g. sys/intf/phys-[eth1/1].

### Optional

- `children` (Attributes List) List of children. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--children))
- `content` (Map of String) Map of key-value pairs that need to be passed to the Model object as parameters.
- `delete` (Boolean) Delete object during destroy operation. Default value is `true`.
- `device` (String) A device name from the provider configuration.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The distinguished name of the object.

<a id="nestedatt--children"></a>
### Nested Schema for `children`

Required:

- `class_name` (String) Class name of the child object.
- `rn` (String) The relative name of the child object.

Optional:

- `content` (Map of String) Map of key-value pairs which represents the attributes of the child object.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = nxos_rest.example
  identity = {
    "dn" : "<dn>"
    "class_name" : "<class_name>"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `class_name` (String) Which class object is being created.
- `dn` (String) Distinguished name of object being managed including its relative name, e.g. sys/intf/phys-[eth1/1].

#### Optional

- `device` (String) A device name from the provider configuration.

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = nxos_rest.example
  id = "<dn>,<class_name>"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import "nxos_rest.l1PhysIf" "sys/intf/phys-[eth1/1],l1PhysIf"
```
