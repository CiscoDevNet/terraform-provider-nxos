# NXOS Provider

The NXOS provider provides resources to interact with one or [more](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/nxos/latest/docs/guides/manage_multiple_devices) Cisco NX-OS devices. Each resource or data source maps to a single NX-OS DME object. There are several [Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=nxos) available which offer a certain level of abstraction and therefore not requiring in-depth knowledge of the DME object model.

The following example repositories exist to demonstrate the use of the provider:

- [Nexus 9000 EVPN Fabric](https://github.com/netascode/terraform-nxos-evpn-example)
- [Nexus 9000 ACLs](https://github.com/netascode/terraform-nxos-acl-example)

It communicates with NX-OS devices via the NX-API REST, which requires the following device configuration.

```
feature nxapi
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform  | Version |
| --------- | ------- |
| Nexus 9Kv | 10.3(1) |
