# Importing Resources

A resource can be imported by using the `terraform import` command or by using an `import` block in the configuration. The resource documentation has an example for the `terraform import` command. An example for importing a resource using the `import` block is shown below. Assuming we have the following resource in our configuration:

```terraform
resource "nxos_bgp" "bgp" {
}
```

We could add an import block to import the resource as shown below:

```terraform
import {
  to = nxos_bgp.bgp
  id = "sys/bgp"
}
```

This will populate the state for the `nxos_bgp` resource for the "default" device. When managing multiple devices, the device name can be appended to the import identifier using a comma as a separator:

```terraform
resource "nxos_bgp" "bgp" {
  device = "LEAF-1"
}

import {
  to = nxos_bgp.bgp
  id = "sys/bgp,LEAF-1"
}
```
